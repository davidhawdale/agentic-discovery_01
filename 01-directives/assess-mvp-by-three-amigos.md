# Assess MVP by Three Amigos

## Goal

Stress-test the MVP brief by assembling a **team** of three specialist agents — a UX Researcher, an Engineer, and a Product Manager — who independently review the brief, then hold a live discussion round where they challenge and build on each other's thinking, and produce a final prioritised assessment.

## Context

The MVP brief (`05-outputs/generate-mvp-document/mvp-brief.md`) synthesises interview research and market analysis into a focused product brief. A document this condensed inevitably makes trade-offs: it emphasises some things and glosses over others. This workflow catches those gaps before resources are committed to building.

The review uses the **DVF framework** (Desirability, Feasibility, Viability) — a standard product assessment lens:

- **Desirability** — Do real users actually want this? Does the brief reflect genuine needs from the research?
- **Feasibility** — Can it be built? Are the technical claims realistic? What hard problems are glossed over?
- **Viability** — Does the business case hold up? Is the market positioning defensible? Is there a path to revenue?

### Why a "Three Amigos" Panel?

A single reviewer tends to agree with itself. Three independent specialists — who first review blind, then actively discuss and challenge each other — surface genuine tensions. The disagreements between lenses are often more valuable than the agreements.

The workflow uses the Claude Code Teams system (`TeamCreate`, `SendMessage`) so specialists genuinely communicate during the discussion round rather than just reading static files.

## Strategic Success Criteria

- Identify weaknesses in the MVP brief before resources are committed
- Surface tensions between what users want (Desirability), what can be built (Feasibility), and what makes business sense (Viability)
- Produce prioritised, actionable recommendations to strengthen the brief
- Ensure the brief is grounded in real research evidence, not assumptions
- Preserve the discussion reasoning as a readable transcript for the project team

## Inputs

| Input | Location | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| MVP Brief | `05-outputs/generate-mvp-document/mvp-brief.md` | Must exist. Generate with `generate-mvp-document` workflow if missing. |
| Strategic Research Brief | `00-brief/strategic-research-brief.md` | Provides the research context and success criteria the brief should serve. |

## Outputs

| Output | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Final assessment | `05-outputs/assess-mvp-by-three-amigos/mvp-three-amigos-assessment.md` |

*The discussion transcript (`04-process/assess-mvp-by-three-amigos/discussion-transcript.md`) is a process artifact and is not promoted to `05-outputs/`.*

## Out of Scope

- Does not re-run or update the MVP brief — review only, no edits to the source document
- Does not validate the underlying research methodology or interview transcripts
- Does not produce a new MVP brief or product strategy document
- Does not assess the VC pitch — for that, use `generate-vc-pitch` output as input to a separate review

## Team Structure

| Role | Agent | Job |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Team Lead** | Orchestrator (you) | Creates team, assigns tasks, records transcript, runs verify, shuts down team |
| **UX Researcher** | `ux-3-amigos-reviewer` | Reviews brief through Desirability lens |
| **Engineer** | `engineer-3-amigos-reviewer` | Reviews brief through Feasibility lens |
| **Product Manager** | `pm-3-amigos-reviewer` | Reviews brief through Viability lens |
| **Synthesiser** | `3-amigos-synthesizer` | Combines all reviews + transcript into final document |

## Acceptance Criteria

The output is complete when **all** of the following are true:

1. Three independent specialist reviews exist (one each for Desirability, Feasibility, Viability)
2. A discussion transcript exists capturing the full Phase 2 exchange between all three specialists
3. The transcript contains genuine back-and-forth — not just three monologues
4. Final synthesis document at `05-outputs/assess-mvp-by-three-amigos/mvp-three-amigos-assessment.md` follows the output template
5. Final document is maximum 5 pages (~2,500 words)
6. Written in bullet points and short sentences throughout — no walls of prose
7. Cross-Cutting Tensions section identifies genuine disagreements between the three lenses
8. Consensus Recommendations section contains no more than 5 prioritised actions that all three lenses support
9. Team is cleanly shut down after completion (no orphaned teammates)
